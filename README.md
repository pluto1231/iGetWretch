# iGetWretch
Script/GUI for batch downloading photo albums from popular Taiwanese site wretch.cc

This utility was developed without version control software. All version history is later manually uploaded to Github.

This project was the longest lived Wretch.cc photo album downloader on OSX/UNIX, always updated to handle Wretch.cc's changes. It is not being developed anymore due to Wretch.cc's site closure.

To use the UNIX version, checkout UNIX branch and download iGetwretch.sh. 
To use OSX GUI, checkout OSX branch and unzip the iGetWretch.zip
